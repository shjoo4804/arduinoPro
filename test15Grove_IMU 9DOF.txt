Before using 9DOF,we need to calibrate the compass frist,It will takes about 2 minutes.
  During  calibratting ,you should rotate and turn the 9DOF all the time within 2 minutes.
  If you are ready ,please sent a command data 'ready' to start sample and calibrate.

9DOF를 사용하기 전에 나침반을 교정해야합니다. 
약 2 분이 소요됩니다.
   
캘리브레이션 중에는 2 분 안에 항상 9DOF를 
돌리고 회전시켜야합니다.
준비가되면 '준비'명령 데이터를 보내 샘플을 
시작하고 보정하십시오.
